**Intro**

This project is a website that details a bicycle tour across America. The website is responsive, which means it will look good on all mobile and desktop screens. 

**Project Description**

I used a design brief from Figma to build this website. I also used grid to organize images on the page, and flex-box to move page elements around. I learned how to use a background image as a link. I also used breakpoints to change font-sizes for different screens, and set relative values for element widths and heights so they would be responsive.

**Figma**

Here's a link to the project design on figma for more information on the blueprint used to build this website.

**Plans on improving the project**
I would like to add more font-sizes for the lead and intro titles and subtitles because the text size change is too drastic between screens, especially in the under 500px range.
